[Introduction]

Researcher: Thank you for joining us today. We're testing the usability of HealthTrack, a mobile app that helps users monitor their fitness and medical conditions. This session will take around 30 minutes. Please feel free to think aloud as you interact with the app.

Participant: Sure, sounds good.

[Task 1: Set a Daily Step Goal]

Researcher: Please open the app and set a daily step goal.

Participant: Okay... hmm... where do I do that? I'm clicking on the profile... No, maybe it's under settings... oh here, 'Goals'.
Researcher: What are you thinking?
Participant: It's not super intuitive. I expected to find the goal-setting on the home screen.

[Task 2: Log Today's Meal]

Researcher: Now, please try to log your lunch.

Participant: Alright. I'm tapping "Food Log"... now I need to search for 'Chicken Salad'... Hmm, this search bar is lagging a bit.
Researcher: Anything surprising?
Participant: Yeah, I thought it would suggest items automatically. Also, the nutritional info is a bit hard to read.

[Task 3: Check Blood Pressure History]

Researcher: Please find your previous blood pressure readings.

Participant: Umm... I don't see anything that says 'Blood Pressure'. Maybe under 'Vitals'?... oh got it.
Researcher: How was that experience?
Participant: Took me a while. The icons are not very clear—maybe add some text labels?

[General Impressions]

Researcher: How would you describe your overall experience using the app?

Participant: Overall, it's okay. The app looks modern and clean, but some features are buried too deep. Also, the font is small—I had to squint a few times. But I like the reminders and daily summaries.

[Closing]

Researcher: Thank you so much. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

Participant: Maybe just a simpler home screen and more personalized recommendations would be nice. Thanks.
